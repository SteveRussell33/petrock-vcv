# Pet Rock VCV

This is an implementation of [Jonah Senzel's Pet Rock](https://petrock.site/) module for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/).

## Credit to Jonah

Most code, imagery, etc. is heavily based on, or directly copied from Jonah's [original open source Pet Rock repository](https://github.com/jsenzel1/petrock/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#pet-rock-eurorack-module)!

## On Choice

> Why did I design the module to limit choice? When choice is
> endless and vast, oddly enough we start to make the same choices
> over and over again (part of ‘blank canvas syndrome’) A system
> with lots of choices needs something to work against; a problem.
> A problem puts us on our toes, forces us to experiment and
> squeeze through tight spots. In the exponentially
> configurable and open world of modular synthesis, this
> module seeks to provide a problem - a fun problem,
> which asks to be dealt with - molded and kneaded
>

In the spirit of Jonah's intention for Pet Rock, the VCV clone doesn't have options, buttons, or context menus, and there is no way to change the internal date.

## Manual

For info on how the pet rock works check out [petrock.site](https://petrock.site/) or the [manual in the original pet-rock repo](https://github.com/jsenzel1/petrock/blob/main/MANUAL%201.0.pdf).

The software version works exactly the same as the manual states, **including fixed 8V outputs**.

## Support the Creators

### VCV Adaptation & Mitch

If you liked this VCV rack implementation and want to support me making more modular stuff [send me a coffee here](https://paypal.me/mitchkeenan)

## "Please, please let me change things!"

Fine... but it won't be fun... you'll need to build from source with `PET_ROCK_DEV_MODE=true` in your environment. Once built/installed right clicking on the module will let you manually various override parameters.
