# Pet Rock VCV

This is an implementation of [Jonah Senzel's Pet Rock](https://petrock.site/) module for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/).

## Credit to Jonah

Most code, imagery, etc. is heavily based on, or directly copied from Jonah's [original open source Pet Rock repository](https://github.com/jsenzel1/petrock/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#pet-rock-eurorack-module)!

## Manual

For info on how Pet Rock works and the ideas it represents check out [petrock.site](https://petrock.site/) and the [manual in the original pet-rock repo](https://github.com/jsenzel1/petrock/blob/main/MANUAL%201.0.pdf).

The software version works exactly the same as the manual states, **including fixed 8V outputs**.

## On Choice & Change

Like the hardware version, Pet Rock's VCV clone doesn't have options, buttons, or menus, and there is no easy way to change the internal date.

> Why did I design the module to limit choice? When choice is
> endless and vast, oddly enough we start to make the same choices
> over and over again (part of ‘blank canvas syndrome’) A system
> with lots of choices needs something to work against; a problem.
> A problem puts us on our toes, forces us to experiment and
> squeeze through tight spots. In the exponentially
> configurable and open world of modular synthesis, this
> module seeks to provide a problem - a fun problem,
> which asks to be dealt with - molded and kneaded
>

### "So I can't hear my patch from yesterday?"

You can, but it's changed... 

> It frustrates me that devices turn off. It spoils the illusion that
> they're real. There's a forest behind my parent's house and a
> thicket of thorns. When I leave it and return things change,
> things have grown, and died. When I turn on my synthesizer it performs
> exactly as it did when I last used it, frozen perfectly in time, switched off. I
> want the synthesizer to show that it still lives when out of my line of sight
> I want it to have object permanence. That way it will be real. Then I can
> come to it, and wake it up, instead of turning it on, and ask it what it has
> to give me. It will serve me what it wants. It will act differently than it did
> before. The living device allows me to see past the turning of knobs, the
> idea that I have ultimate control. It speaks and I listen, and it has moods,
> and phases. Devices need not be static, they can have lives of their own,
> changing with the passage of time, sitting in a drawer and thinking,
> acting differently when taken out.
